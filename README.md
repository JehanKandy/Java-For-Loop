# Java-For-Loop
Java For Loop
<br><br>
<b>Code Explain</b>

for basic of code follow the following link: <br>
https://github.com/JehanKandy/First-Coding-with-JAVA
<br>

.java file

        public class for_loop {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                for(int i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
                    System.out.println("Hello World...!");
                }
            }    
        }



and According to following code part, 

        for(int i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
             System.out.println("Hello World...!");
        }

I use for loop and <br>
inside of the for loop I create veriable named 'i' with int data type
<br><br>

Accordig to int data type we can only add integer values,
<br>and the I cheack the i value is less than or equal to 10

and the i make incremented one by one to i value,<br>
at the first the i value is 0;

<br>
after that
